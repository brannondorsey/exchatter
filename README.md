# ExChatter

ExChatter is a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) framework for creating personalized chat bots. Take a look at the [proposed APIs](API/) to get a feel for how it will work and check back soon to use it. ExChatter is being custom developed for [this project](http://github.com/brannondorsey/exes) but will be highly extensible and well documented upon its completion.
